# This project implements a Fake News Detection System using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree with TF-IDF vectorization, as well as a GPT Few-Shot Learning approach. The model is trained on a dataset of real and fake news articles to classify whether a given news article is real or fake.

ðŸ›  Features:
âœ” Preprocessing of news articles (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
âœ” TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
âœ” Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifier with 98.8% accuracy
âœ” Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score
